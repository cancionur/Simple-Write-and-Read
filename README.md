# Simple-Write-and-Read

Writing and Reading a simple text by using BufferedWriter and BufferedReader in Android Studio.

## How it works ?

If we don't have any kind of file on the path, firstly we create the file. After that we write a simple text to the file by using BufferedWriter object.
And then if we want to see what it is in the file. We need to read it, so we can do this by using BufferedReader.
